Hello, my name is Benoit Chouinard, an Electrical Engineering student at the university of Carleton. I am currently learning machine learning with pytorch. 
I am also working on a crypto bot that will use machine learning.
I've learned some advanced python and I am now very proficient in it so after this project, I will probably try and learn C++ and app development.
